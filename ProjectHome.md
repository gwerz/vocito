[Vocito](http://code.google.com/p/vocito/downloads/list) is a desktop UI for [GrandCentral](http://www.grandcentral.com) for the Mac. It allows you to easily dial anybody from your desktop. Using [GrandCentral](http://www.grandcentral.com) it will dial the remote phone and your local phone simultaneously, and connect you together.

**Please note that Vocito _does not_ work with Google Voice at this time.**

I will update it to work with Voice as soon as I have time.

It integrates into Address Book, [Quicksilver](http://www.blacktree.com/), [Automater](http://automator.us/leopard/index.html), system services, supports "tel" URLs, and is fully AppleScriptable.

All this integration makes it easy to have Vocito automatically dial your phone from just about any application that supports scripting, html, or [Automator](http://automator.us/leopard/index.html) actions. For example, you can easily set up your iCal meeting appointment to automatically dial the conference call for you at the correct time.

Vocito also allows you to save little applets that will automatically dial the phone for you with a simple double click.

Since [GrandCentral](http://www.grandcentral.com) is currently in a limited beta, we don't have any more invites to hand out right now. So those of you without a [GrandCentral](http://www.grandcentral.com) number don't get to play just yet, but please [reserve your number now](http://www.grandcentral.com/home/reserve) to get in on the action as soon as more invites become available.

[Vocito is available here for download](http://code.google.com/p/vocito/downloads/list). It works on Tiger and Leopard, is both PowerPC and Intel native, and is fully open sourced. There is a discussion group at [vocito-discuss](http://groups.google.com/group/vocito-discuss) on Google Groups, and an [FAQ](http://code.google.com/p/vocito/wiki/VocitoHelp?ts=1227075184&updated=VocitoHelp#Trouble_Shooting_and_FAQ).
