  # Click on the Vocito item and type in a phone number to call in the "Call" drop down and a phone number you want to receive the call at in the "From" drop down.
  # Click on the "Dial" Button
    * If this is the first time you have run Vocito you will now be prompted for your GrandCentral ID, and your GrandCentral password. These will be stored in your Keychain for future use.
    * Assuming that your login information is entered correctly, Vocito will now dial both phones. When they are both answered, they will be connected together.

Other notes:
  * Clicking on the "Address Book" icon will open your Address Book and let you select numbers from there.
  * The "From" Drop down menu is initially populated with your phone numbers as listed on your Address Book card.
  * Clicking on the "Gear" button will give you more options.

Have fun!
