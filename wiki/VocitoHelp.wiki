  # Click on the Vocito item and type in a phone number to call in the "Call" drop down and a phone number you want to receive the call at in the "From" drop down.
  # Click on the "Dial" Button
    * If this is the first time you have run Vocito you will now be prompted for your !GrandCentral ID, and your !GrandCentral password. These will be stored in your Keychain for future use.
    * Assuming that your login information is entered correctly, Vocito will now dial both phones. You will see progress text telling you what is happening scroll up in the menu bar. The phones should both start to ring momentarily. When they are both answered, they will be connected together.

Other notes:
  * Clicking on the "Address Book" icon will open your Address Book and let you select numbers from there.
  * The "From" Drop down menu is initially populated with your phone numbers as listed on your Address Book card.
  * Clicking on the "Gear" button will give you more options.

Have fun!

= Trouble Shooting =
  _ _*Q)* Vocito tells me that I have entered my login information incorrectly<br>
  _ _*A)* Go to the "Vocito" menu and open the window. Click on the "Gear" icon. Select "Preferences" update your information with your correct login information. To get your login information, go to http://www.grandcentral.com and attempt to login there.

  _ _*Q)* Vocito won't dial a 7 digit number<br>
  _ _*A)* Vocito requires an area code, because Grand Central requires an area code. Please add an area code to make it a 10 digit number.

  _ _*Q)* I logged out, and Vocito isn't in my menu bar anymore. How can I get it to stay there?<br>
  _ _*A)* Add it to your startup items. Go to System Preferences, and choose the "Accounts" panel. Then choose the "Login Items" tab. Click on the "Plus" button at the bottom of the screen and select the Vocito application. More information about Startup items is [http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2602 here]

You can also enter a number directly into Quicksilver for Vocito to dial by typing a period "." followed by a 10 digit number (area code + number).

= Automator support =
Vocito can also be used via Automator. The action is called "Call With Vocito".

The "Use Input" menu allows you to choose whether the data entering the action will be used for the "call number", the "from number" or ignored. The data will be passed through to the next action if appropriate.

= System Service support =
Select a block of text in almost any application, and then go to the Services menu (under the current Application menu) and choose "Call with Vocito". Vocito will attempt to parse a phone number out of the selected text if possible. The number must be 10 digits (area code + number).

= !AppleScript support =
Vocito supports a single command: *dial* text [*from* text]

A simple Vocito script would look like this:
{{{
tell app "Vocito"
  dial "1234567890" from "9876543210"
end tell
}}}
